<h2>What I've enjoyed about this tutorial:</h2>
<p>I've done some work with HTML and CSS through my Full Stack Web Development course but working with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS (which we didn't use in the course) was a big game changer. It made creating a website more simpler and exciting due to how fast and easy it is to execute once you know how to put components together. The website on the tutorial was something I thought would be very complicated to create but with the proper use of Tailwind CSS and imported files, it made it seem too easy.</p>
